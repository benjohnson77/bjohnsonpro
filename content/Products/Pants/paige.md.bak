description: "In the darkest wash of the season, this is the perfect jean to transition into fall and beyond. This modern slim straight fit comes in a clean dark wash with contrast stitching for a classic denim look. This pair is cut from TRANSCEND denim which guarantees the most comfortable fit with premium stretch and recovery for everyday wear. Paige also has many different colors and styles with the same great feel."

review: "Transcend demim is Paige's stretch demin product. The Jeans have a athlesuire type feel. I would rather wear these then sweats and the look very polished. They can take a beating and still look good after many washes."

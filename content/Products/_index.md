You should wear pants. At least if you leaving the house pants are good. However, while working from home I grew used to wearing sweats or shorts. The first time I went to put on the same old pre-covid jeans my soft athleisure accustomed skin cried out in first world agony. These options look good in a business casual setting are wrinkle free but maintain a level of comfort that betrays their style.
